# CacheCraft

## Overview
**CacheCraft** is a comprehensive repository dedicated to the implementation and study of various caching mechanisms and design patterns. This project aims to provide a learning platform for developers to understand and apply different caching strategies and design patterns in real-world scenarios.

## Objectives
- **Educational Resource**: Serve as a learning tool for developers to grasp the concepts of caching and design patterns.
- **Practical Implementations**: Provide hands-on examples and code implementations of various caching strategies.
- **Design Patterns**: Explore how different design patterns can be applied to enhance caching mechanisms.
- **Best Practices**: Highlight best practices and common pitfalls in cache design and implementation.

## Features
- **Variety of Caches**: Implementations of different types of caches such as in-memory cache, distributed cache, write-through cache, write-back cache, and more.
- **Design Patterns**: Examples of applying design patterns like Singleton, Factory, Strategy, Decorator, and Proxy in caching scenarios.
- **Code Examples**: Well-documented code examples in multiple programming languages.
- **Use Cases**: Real-world use cases and scenarios demonstrating the application of different caching techniques.
